This is an implementation of the <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/nodejs-members-only"> Members Only project </a> completed as part of the Node.js lessons provided by The Odin Project's full stack Javascript course.

<h1> Learnings </h1>
This project was an opportunity to develop authentication skills and to show unique Views based on User's privileges.

I now have a clearer understanding of how Authentication works in the Backend and the importance of hashing and salting when storing User passwords. This process is critical for safety and provides a more secure way to store Users passwords incase of a database breach.

In future projects I want to explore using OAuth authentication methods provided by Passportjs

<h1>Built using</h1>
<ul>
  <li>Node/Express</li>
  <li>Passport JS for local authentication</li>
  <li>Mongodb</li>
  <li>EJS- Views</li>
</ul>
